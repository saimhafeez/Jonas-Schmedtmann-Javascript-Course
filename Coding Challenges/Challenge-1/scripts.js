JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1
Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
Â§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ */

const weightMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const weightJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const bmiMark = weightMark / heightMark ** 2;
const bmiJohn = weightJohn / heightJohn ** 2;

const markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;

console.log(
  'Mark BMI: ' + bmiMark,
  'John BMI: ' + bmiJohn,
  'marksHigherBMI: ' + markHigherBMI
);
